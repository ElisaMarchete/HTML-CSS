# HTML / CSS

Debugging the website was an interesting and eficient way to consolidate the contant provided in class. 

The hands-on challange provided the real world experience, where I could touch and improve the code while learning.

HTML semantic elements, HTML accessibility, and CSS DRY grouping selectors were some of the problems solved. The website has been refactored without changing the functionality, the code now is cleaner than it was before, and the accessibility has been improved.
